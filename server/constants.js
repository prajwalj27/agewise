    story:
      'In a small village, there lived a farmer. He was known for his greed and selfishness. One day, a poor old woman asked him for some food as she was hungry. The farmer, unwilling to share, ignored her plea. That night, he dreamt of a wise sage who warned him of the consequences of his actions. The next day, the farmer decided to change his ways. He began sharing his harvest with the needy and found true happiness in giving. From that day forward, he became a respected and contented member of the community.',

    title: 'The Two Wolves',
    story:
      "An old Cherokee chief told his grandson, 'Within each person, there are two wolves constantly at war. One is evil, full of anger, jealousy, and greed. The other is good, filled with love, kindness, and compassion.' The grandson thought for a moment and asked, 'Grandfather, which wolf wins?' The chief replied, 'The one you feed.' The story teaches us that our thoughts and actions shape our character. By nurturing positive qualities within ourselves, we can overcome negativity and lead a more fulfilling life.",

    story:
      "Once in a bustling marketplace, a rich merchant dropped a shiny golden coin. A poor old man noticed it and picked it up. Instead of keeping it for himself, he handed it back to the merchant. The merchant, impressed by the old man's honesty, rewarded him generously. Later, the old man revealed, 'I am not poor. I am rich with contentment and honesty.' The moral of the story is that true wealth lies in integrity and the joy of doing what is right, rather than material possessions.",
